Plugin developed in 2020 for the Westworld Minecraft Server

Commissioned by the Westworld RPG Minecraft server in the summer of 2020.

This plugin adds a lot of things necessary for a Wild West RPG experience:
- Custom player nametags to support names with first and last names, instead of Minecraft-limited usernames. Supported by NickAPI.
- Proximity chat, OOC chat.
- Renting system with expiration, extension of rents. Additionally, players can lockpick each others' doors with a small chance of success.
- A combat system that is based on dual consent, preventing RDM.
- A heist system accompanied by a wanted system, for occasional action.
- A custom horse ownership system, where each player can own multiple horses, see each of their stats and select based on their needs. Horses have to be selected at the Horsekeeper.
- An introduction system for players new to the server, where they are guided through choosing their custom name, custom cosmetics and are introduced to what to expect.
- A train system, for quick travel between far away places. Trains run on schedules.
